# Installation

To install Abra, download the repository from https://github.com/anandrav/abra.
Then, run the script located at /scripts/install

```
git clone https://github.com/anandrav/abra
cd abra
./scripts/install
```

## Requirements
### Cargo
Cargo, the Rust package manager, is required to run the install script. The best way to install Cargo is by using [rustup](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
### Node
If you're using Visual Studio Code and want to install the Abra extension, you'll want to [install Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) as well before running the install script.
